                    I'm passionate about building software that makes a real difference. Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of working on fascinating projects across various industries - from revolutionizing document management systems for automotive companies to creating engaging dating platforms and educational tools that help students succeed.

                <p class="summary-text" style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    What drives me is the challenge of turning complex business requirements into elegant, efficient solutions. Whether it's optimizing database queries to run 30% faster or architecting systems that handle thousands of users without breaking a sweat, I love the problem-solving aspect of development. I'm also deeply committed to mentoring the next generation of developers - there's nothing quite like seeing someone you've taught land their dream job in tech.
